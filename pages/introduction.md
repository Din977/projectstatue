## Historical records of Buddhism to the West
___________________________________________
**Introduction**

Buddhism is one of the most ancient religion present Buddhist history goes back till Siddhratha Gautam who was born 2500 B.C. During the time of Buddha, Buddhism was just limited to Indian sub continent. Buddhism has widely spread at the time of Emperor Asoka. Under his patronage Buddhist missionary monks were sent to nine different places.  Even at that time there was no written record and evidence were discovery about Buddhism in the west. However, in my opinion, the western must have idea about Buddha and Buddhism because of wanderers, traders and traveller monks. 
According to historical record and evidence, Alexander the great, could be consider as the first westerner from Kingdom of Macedon who invaded India in 326 BC. Although, there is historical record proved his India visit was not just a visit as the expansion of Greek empire to Asia. But along with him, Greek style art were domesticated in India.  Greek sculpture influences were depicted in art and architecture of India sculpture. 

### Orientalists role 

Orientalists scholars played vital role to introduce Buddhism in the west. Although, Buddhism was known in the west but it was just consider as only one of the Asian religion. But in 17th century, “L'introduction à l'histoire du buddhisme indien,” (Paris 1844)by Eugene Burnouf gave recognition and exposition to  Buddhism in the west. After his works a number of studies, translation and treatises were written which gave opportunities to flourish Buddha’s teaching in the west.  Burnouf (1801-52) imposed a rational structuring on ideas hitherto perceived as unrelated and in so doing created the "prototype of the European concept of Buddhism"13
In 19th century, the emergence of the "Oriental Renaissance," played a crucial role to propagate Buddhism in Germany, in this time, the cultural and intellectual movement in Europe was highly discussed and spread. During this period, European scholars, philosophers, and artists developed a renewed interest in Eastern cultures, particularly those from Asia and the Middle East. Key aspects of the Oriental Renaissance include the philosophical engagement with Eastern thought, the translation and study of Eastern texts, the influence of Eastern art on European art and aesthetics, the exploration of Eastern religions, comparative studies between Eastern and Western traditions, and its impact on Western literature and culture. The Oriental Renaissance marked a significant shift in Western attitudes towards and engagement with Eastern cultures, contributing to a deeper understanding of both Eastern and Western traditions. Arthur Schopenhauer's work on Eastern philosophy, especially his interpretation of the concept of "will" in Indian thought, played a pivotal role in popularizing Eastern ideas in Europe during this period. In Germany, following the enthusiastic interpretations of the 'Oriental Renaissance', the writings of Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1869) inspired a wide interest in Buddhist philosophy and ethics among intellectuals, academics and artists.11

### Buddhist Missionary to the west

Buddhist missionary activity in the west can be considered as an anti-Christianity movement in the South East Asia. During 19th centuries most Asian countries were colonized by British Empire and most aristocratic families were converted Christian. As to tackle Notable figures like Anagārika Dharmapāla, a Sri Lankan Buddhist revivalist, played a crucial role in introducing Buddhism to the West. Dharmapāla participated in the 1893 World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago, where he delivered lectures on Buddhism. After a public lecture by Anagârika Dharmapâla (1864-1933) at the Chicago 'World Parliament of Religions' in 1893,. Carl Theodor Strauss (1852-1937) formally to convert to Buddhist on American soil He was the First German-American.
The Theosophical society played a significant role in the spread of Eastern and esoteric spiritual teachings in the West and had a notable impact on the New Age movement and modern spirituality. The Theosophical Society emphasized the study of comparative religion, metaphysics, and the exploration of hidden knowledge, promoting concepts such as karma, reincarnation, and the existence of spiritual teacher. This society gave oppitinuity to blossom Buddhism in the west. It was founded by individuals like Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, Henry Steel Olcott, and William Quan Judge and had a profound impact on the spread of Eastern and esoteric spiritual teachings in the West. The Theosophical Society played a pivotal role in introducing Eastern spiritual concepts, particularly those from Hinduism and Buddhism, to Western audiences. Blavatsky's writings and lectures emphasized the esoteric aspects of these traditions. The society's interest in Eastern spirituality contributed to the broader fascination with Eastern philosophies and practices during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the West.

### Converted westerners

Many Westerners have converted to Buddhism over the years, drawn to its teachings, philosophy, and practices. Some Westerners traveled to Asian countries to become ordained as Buddhist monks and nuns. For example, Allen Bennett McGregor (Ananda Metteyya) and Anton W. F. Gueth (Nyānatiloka) became notable European monks. They engaged in Buddhist activities in Asian countries and also returned to the West to promote Buddhism. Ananda Metteyya (Allan Bennett): Ananda Metteyya was a British-born Buddhist monk who converted to Buddhism in the early 20th century. He was one of the first Westerners to be ordained in the Theravāda tradition. Metteyya played a significant role in spreading Buddhism in the West and was involved in Buddhist activities in Asia. Nyānatiloka Mahāthera (Anton Gueth): Nyānatiloka was a German who became a Buddhist monk in Sri Lanka. He was a prolific author and translator of Buddhist texts and contributed to the dissemination of Theravāda Buddhism in Europe. Conversion of Westerners: The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw some Westerners converting to Buddhism. Notable examples include Paul Carus, Karl Eugen Neumann, and Ananda Metteyya. These individuals became self-converted followers of Buddhist teachings and played roles in the dissemination of Buddhism in the West.

### Buddhist Organizations in the west

 Buddhist organizations and societies began to form in the West during the early 20th century. Anagārika Dharmapāla founded branches of the Maha Bodhi Society in various Western countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. These organizations aimed to promote Buddhist practices and principles.

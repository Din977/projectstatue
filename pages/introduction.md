## Historical records of Buddhism to the West
---------------------------------------------

#### Introduction

Buddhism is one of the most ancient religions present Buddhist history goes back to Siddhartha Gautam who was born in 2500 B.C. During the time of Buddha, Buddhism was limited to the Indian subcontinent. Buddhism was widely spread at the time of Emperor Asoka. Under his patronage, Buddhist missionary monks were sent to nine different places.  Even at that time, there was no written record and evidence of where discovery of Buddhism in the West. However, in my opinion, Westerners must have an idea about Buddha and Buddhism because of wanderers, traders, and traveler monks.
According to historical records and evidence, King Menadra, (Pali Milindo) (160 BCE-135 BCE)was the first Western King who visited and converted into Buddhist follower after having a dialog with Bhikkhu Nagasena. As recorded in the famous Buddhist book the king Milindo-panha.(“ The question of Milinda”).[1]  After that Alexander the Great could be considered the another Westerner from the Kingdom of Macedon who invaded India in 326 BC. However, there is a historical record proving his India visit was not just a visit to the expansion of the Greek empire to Asia. But along with him, Greek-style art was domesticated in India.  Greek sculpture influences were depicted in the art and architecture of Indian sculpture. These historical record shows Buddhist was already well known in the west. 

#### Orientalists role

Orientalist scholars played a vital role in introducing Buddhism to the West. Although Buddhism was known in the West, it was considered only one of the Asian religions. But in the 17th century, “L'introduction à l'histoire du buddhisme indien,” (Paris 1844)by Eugene Burnouf gave recognition and exposition to Buddhism in the West. After his works, many studies, translations, and treatises were written which gave opportunities to flourish Buddha’s teaching in the West.  Burnouf (1801-52) imposed a rational structuring on ideas hitherto perceived as unrelated and in so doing created the "prototype of the European concept of Buddhism"[2]
Edwin Arnold’s (1879) “Light of Asia”, book also provides wider outreach to Buddhism in the West. Colonel Henry Steel Olcott’s Buddhist Catechism in 1881 and Friedrich Zimmermann’s(1865-1915) The Buddhist Catechism (1888) glorified the Asian religion. As an outcome of that, Paul Carus in 1880 became the first Westerner Buddhist. Then, Karl Eugen Neumann(1865-1915) self-converted as a Buddhist follower.  
In the 19th century, the emergence of the "Oriental Renaissance," played a crucial role in propagating Buddhism in Germany, in this time, the cultural and intellectual movement in Europe was highly discussed and spread. During this period, European scholars, philosophers, and artists developed a renewed interest in Eastern cultures, particularly those from Asia and the Middle East. Key aspects of the Oriental Renaissance include the philosophical engagement with Eastern thought, the translation and study of Eastern texts, the influence of Eastern art on European art and aesthetics, the exploration of Eastern religions, comparative studies between Eastern and Western traditions, and its impact on Western literature and culture. The Oriental Renaissance marked a significant shift in Western attitudes towards and engagement with Eastern cultures, contributing to a deeper understanding of both Eastern and Western traditions. Arthur Schopenhauer's work on Eastern philosophy, especially his interpretation of the concept of "will" in Indian thought, played a pivotal role in popularizing Eastern ideas in Europe during this period. In Germany, following the enthusiastic interpretations of the 'Oriental Renaissance', the writings of Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1869) inspired a wide interest in Buddhist philosophy and ethics among intellectuals, academics, and artists.[3]

#### Buddhist Missionary to the West


Buddhist missionary activity in the West can be considered as an anti-Christianity movement in the South East Asia. During the 19th century, most Asian countries were colonized by the Westerners Portuguese were the first, then Dutch and the English. The British Empire ruled the Indian subcontinent for a long time. To gain power and dominance, most aristocratic families from India and Sri Lanka were converted to Christianity. In the against this movement notable figures like Anagārika Dharmapāla, a Sri Lankan Buddhist revivalist, played a crucial role in introducing Buddhism-preserving champions from India to other countries. As a result. Buddhism was introduced to the West. Dharmapāla participated in the 1893 World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago, where he delivered lectures on Buddhism. After a public speech by Anagârika Dharmapâla (1864-1933) at the Chicago 'World Parliament of Religions' in 1893, Carl Theodor Strauss (1852-1937) formally converted to Buddhism on American soil, He was the First German-American.[3]
The Theosophical society played a significant role in the spread of Eastern and esoteric spiritual teachings in the West and had a notable impact on the New Age movement and modern spirituality. The Theosophical Society emphasized the study of comparative religion, metaphysics, and the exploration of hidden knowledge, promoting concepts such as karma, reincarnation, and the existence of a spiritual teacher. This society gave an opportunity to blossom Buddhism in the West. It was founded by individuals like Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, Henry Steel Olcott, and William Quan Judge and had a profound impact on the spread of Eastern and esoteric spiritual teachings in the West. The Theosophical Society played a pivotal role in introducing Eastern spiritual concepts, particularly those from Hinduism and Buddhism, to Western audiences. Blavatsky's writings and lectures emphasized the esoteric aspects of these traditions. The society's interest in Eastern spirituality contributed to the broader fascination with Eastern philosophies and practices during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the West.

#### Converted Westerners

Many Westerners have converted to Buddhism over the years, drawn to its teachings, philosophy, and practices. Some Westerners traveled to Asian countries to become ordained as Buddhist monks and nuns. For example, Allen Bennett McGregor (Ananda Metteyya) and Anton W. F. Gueth (Nyānatiloka) became notable European monks. They engaged in Buddhist activities in Asian countries and also returned to the West to promote Buddhism. Ananda Metteyya (Allan Bennett): Ananda Metteyya was a British-born Buddhist monk who converted to Buddhism in the early 20th century. He was one of the first Westerners to be ordained in the Theravāda tradition. Metteyya played a significant role in spreading Buddhism in the West and was involved in Buddhist activities in Asia. Nyānatiloka Mahāthera (Anton Gueth): Nyānatiloka was a German who became a Buddhist monk in Sri Lanka. He was a prolific author and translator of Buddhist texts and contributed to the dissemination of Theravāda Buddhism in Europe. Conversion of Westerners: The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw some Westerners converting to Buddhism. Notable examples include Paul Carus, Karl Eugen Neumann, and Ananda Metteyya. These individuals became self-converted followers of Buddhist teachings and played roles in the dissemination of Buddhism in the West.
 
 #### Buddhist Organizations in the West
 
Buddhist organizations and societies began to form in the West during the early 20th century in order to disseminate Buddhist teaching in the West. Buddhist organizations were established as the center of contact places and the place for the propagation of Buddhist doctrine to Westerners and the Western diaspora.  
Maha Bodhi Society could be considered one of the oldest Buddhist societies in the West it was established by Anagārika Dharmapāla as a branch of the Maha Bodhi Society, Calcutta. The Maha Bodhi Society branches spread not only in Asia but also in various Western countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. These organizations aimed to promote Buddhist practices and principles. The Buddhist Society of Great Britain and Ireland’ in London (1907)was formed as a Buddhist-promoting society in the West, where educated upper and middle classes were targeted to teach Buddhism by Ananda Metteyya.

#### Buddhism in Germany

Although, Paul Carus and Karl Eugen Neumann(1865-1915) were pioneers and the foremost Buddhists in Germany the role of Dr.Karl seidenstücker as well as Georg Grimm can’t be underestimated. They have played a crucial role in establishing and preserving Buddhism in Germany. Society for the Buddhist Mission in Germany was the first missionary society (1903) established in Leipzig by Dr.Karl Seidenstücker. In 1921, Georg Grimm(1868-1945) and seidenstücker appointed itinerant preacher in “Buddhist Parish for Germany” This is a religious community where lay people participate and members practice Buddhist activities by following ethical precepts. Likewise, after the development and increasing number of members in society in 1924, Dr.Paul Dahlke built a dedicated Buddhist house or monastery for himself and extended more hermitages in later years for meditation propose. In addition, Dahlke had an eleven foot high memorial stone erected on the North German island of Sylt, paying public homage to the Buddha.[4]

#### Japanese Buddhism

After the destruction from the world war, Japanese society had overcome gradually and went through the path of modernity from where they were able to access international networks. As protestant missionaries, Japanese Zen Buddhists also approached a similar way to introduce Buddhism in the West. D.T. Suzuki (1870-1966) played a vital role in bringing Buddhism to the light in the West. His contributions included introducing Zen philosophy, meditation practices, and the cultural significance of Zen to Western audiences. Suzuki authored several influential books in English, such as "An Introduction to Zen Buddhism" and "Zen and Japanese Culture," which helped demystify Zen teachings. He collaborated with Western thinkers like Carl Jung and Martin Heidegger to bridge the gap between Eastern and Western philosophical traditions. Suzuki emphasized the experiential aspect of Zen and meditation, advocating that it was not just a philosophy but a way of life. His legacy includes being a significant figure in the transmission of Zen Buddhism to the West and his enduring impact on the fields of Buddhism, philosophy, and spirituality.

## About the Collection
This digital exhibit focuses on three different traditional Buddhist centers located in North Rhine-Westphalia of Germany. Here I want to show the existence of different Buddhist schools in Germany and my primary subject is the Buddha statue and their heritage, besides that, I would like to highlight their adherent, the surrounding atmosphere, as well as their other activities.
As a showcase, I presented a variety of photographs taken by me from the Buddhist Center of Düsseldorf, Wat Buddhasamakkee Duisburg, and The EKO-Haus der Japanishchen Kultur e.V, Düsseldorf.
In these photographs. I want to show the outer look of the Center, how do they arrange the praying hall, and what are the unique things they kept in their main hall. How do they try to link with their origin place? How much importance is given to aesthetic beauty? What are the decorative objects? Who are their main targeted groups? How do they attract new visitors? 
In order to make this project successful, I visited all three places and participated in their program and also interacted with some people, and then observed there.

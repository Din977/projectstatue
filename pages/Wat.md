## Wat Thai Samakhee non-profit association e.V.
Wat Thai Samakhee is a non-profit association whose aim is to cultivate Buddhism and the Thai tradition in Schwäbisch Gmünd, Germany.

In their daily monastic life they are actively supported by many volunteers. Several times a year, guest monks from Thailand visit our temple to hold various ceremonies and courses. Teachers from Thailand are also invited to give lectures in music, dance, folk art and Thai history.

The association is supported by thousands of Buddhists, mostly of Thai origin. Many people who care about the integration and diversity of cultures are also involved. Wat Thai Samakhee stands for open-mindedness and tolerance.

### THE TEACHINGS OF BUDDHA
Buddhism originated over two and a half thousand years ago and is considered one of the great world religions.

The teachings of the Buddha show ways out of suffering and imperfection to harmony and happiness. The essential practices of Buddhism are based on ethical behaviour, meditation and wisdom. No blind faith is demanded. The focus is on the individual's own responsibility. Buddhism does not proselytise.

## About the Collection

This digital exhibit focuses on three different traditional Buddhist centers located in North Rhine-Westphalia of Germany. Here I want to show the existence of different Buddhist schools in Germany and my primary subject is the Buddha statue and their heritage, besides that, I would like to highlight their adherent, the surrounding atmosphere, as well as their other activities.

As a showcase, I presented a variety of photographs taken by me from the Buddhist Center of Düsseldorf, Wat Buddhasamakkee Duisburg, and The EKO-Haus der Japanishchen Kultur e.V, Düsseldorf.

In these photographs. I want to show the outer look of the Center,

> how do they arrange the praying hall?
> what are the unique things they kept in their main hall.
> How do they try to link with their origin place?
> How much importance is given to aesthetic beauty?
> What are the decorative objects?
> Who are their main targeted groups?
> How do they attract new visitors?

In order to make this project successful, I visited all three places and participated in their program and also interacted with some people, and then observed there.

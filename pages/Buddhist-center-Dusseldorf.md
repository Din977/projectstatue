## Buddhist centre Dusseldorf (The Diamond Way Buddhism)
Buddhist Centre Düsseldorf is located at unterbilk. This center is established as meeting point for those who are interested about Buddhism and get explanations about meditation from experienced Buddhist practitioners. The main propose of the center is to provide open access to the method of Diamond way Buddhism.
This centre was established in the initiation of Lama Ole Nydahl and his wife Hannah, Lama Ole Nydahl, a Western Buddhist master born in Denmark, established Diamond Way Buddhism in the 1970’s, together with his wife Hannah Nydahl. They both worked since the 1970s to translate and spread the Karma Kagyu lineage of lay Tibetan Buddhism in the West. After several years in the Himalayas learning and traveling with the 16th Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe Dorje and other Tibetan meditation masters, Lama Ole Nydahl and his wife Hannah set off back to Denmark. 
Karmapa empowered them to bring the Vajrayana transmission and Buddhist teachings they had received to the West and see if there was anyone interested. At first reluctant to leave their beloved teacher, they finally agreed. Thus in 1972 began their journey of bringing Buddhism to the West.
Having been given the all-important authorization to teach, they kept the traditional meditations and left behind the cultural elements, in order to make the wisdom tradition of the East understandable and relevant to modern Western people. 

They founded Diamond Way Buddhism for lay students of Karma Kagyu Buddhism, which is now one of the most widespread Buddhist schools in the West. Diamond Way Buddhism belongs to the thousand-year-old Karma Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. Their main teacher the 16th Karmapa asked them to teach what they had learned and to start Buddhist centres in the West.
More than 40 years later, there are now 640 Diamond Way Buddhist centers around the world. The meditation methods that you can learn in these centres are all traditional Buddhist teachings, but adjust according to modern style, gave access to all. Lama Ole has taught a number of students as lay Diamond Way Buddhist teachers with his long experience. He give practical explanations about Buddhism in Diamond Way centres.
Thaye Dorje, His Holiness the 17th Gyalwa Karmapa and other high Buddhist teachers such as Sherab Gyaltsen Rinpoche and Lama Jigme Rinpoche visit Diamond Way Buddhist centers and teach and conduct a large meditation courses.

The Diamond Way Buddhism Foundation coordinates international cultural and academic initiatives and is the holder of selected real estate and Lama Ole and Hannah Nydahl’s intellectual property. It offers support and expertise to Buddhist centres and projects.
Diamond Way Buddhists often travel to different countries and centres, to see their teachers and meet with other practitioners. The central international place where this enriching human exchange happens is the Europe Center, which was bought by the Diamond Way Buddhism Foundation in 2007. The Europe Center consists of several buildings and 50 hectares of forest and meadows in the beautiful setting of the Bavarian Alps in Germany.
